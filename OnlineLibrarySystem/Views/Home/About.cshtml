                Welcome to the Online Book Library System — your digital gateway to discovering, managing, and enjoying books from anywhere.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <p>
                Our platform is built using <strong>ASP.NET Core MVC</strong> with <strong>Entity Framework Core</strong> and a SQL Server backend.
                We aim to offer a simple and efficient way for users to manage a library of books online.
            </p>

            <p>
                With features like adding, viewing, editing, and deleting books, our goal is to support students and developers in understanding
                real-world web application architecture using the MVC pattern.
            </p>

            <p>
                Future enhancements may include role-based access, user-specific libraries, book recommendations, and cloud-based deployment via Azure.
